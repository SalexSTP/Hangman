# Hangman
Hangman C# Project
# Task of the Game:

- the goal is to guess the missing word.
- you will have underscores where the missing letters should be placed.
- if the letter that you have chosen is in the answer then all the underscores where the letter should go will be filled out.
- every time you choose a wrong letter you lose a life and the hangman starts building up.
- you should solve the word before the hangman dies.
- you can try to guess the word immediately without checking every letter and win the game this way.
- if you type the same word twice or more the game will tell you that you have already used the word and try to type another word without removing a life.
